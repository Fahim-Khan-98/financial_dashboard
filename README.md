Let's break down the calculations step by step based on the information provided:

Total Expense:
Total Expense = Salary + Snacks + Bill
Total Expense = $200 + $50 + $100
Total Expense = $350

Net Income:
Net Income = Total Sales - Total Expense - Revenue
Net Income = $1000 - $350 - $500
Net Income = $150

Current Ratio:
Current Ratio = Total Sales / Total Expense
Current Ratio = $1000 / $350
Current Ratio = 2.86 (approximately)

Debt to Equity Ratio:

Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Expense / Revenue
Debt to Equity Ratio = $350 / $500
Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.7 (or 70%)


Than calculate average Current ratio = Total Current Ratio / Number of companies
calculate Average Debt To Equity Ratio = Total Debt To Equity Ratio / Number of companies
